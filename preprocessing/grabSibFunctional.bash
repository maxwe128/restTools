####Description####
#Based on SibStudy queries that were made with MDG, This script grabs all Sib Study functional data, untars and organizes it.
##The initial reason for doing this is so that all ib study functional can be concatenated and used as "pseudo-rest" to have a large
##FC-MRI dataset for projects like parcellation, genetic seed comparisons and Schizophrenia projects.
