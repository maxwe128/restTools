####Description
#called within prep4Uber.bash to choose each participants best ${numRest} scans within each visit and then choose best visit.
#Does this by meanFD solely


#Edit prep4Uber to allow a specification that looks for averaged anat that is closest in age to best rest
#May want to play with calling from helix so that you can look in wmg dirs after swarming 
#might be easiest to just grab the best anats and after call a separate script from helix that looks for an averaged anat
#and clears the current anat if the averaged anat is present and close enough in age
